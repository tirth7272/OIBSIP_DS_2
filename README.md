In this task, I analyzed two datasets covering unemployment rates across different regions in India. I began by cleaning and preprocessing the data, including handling missing values and standardizing date formats for consistency. Using line plots, I compared unemployment trends over time, highlighting patterns and anomalies across regions. Monthly averages were also calculated to provide a clearer view of fluctuations in the unemployment rate over time.

To deepen the analysis, I created visualizations such as a monthly bar chart of average unemployment rates and a stacked area chart to show unemployment rates by region. These visualizations helped me uncover regional trends and identify key time periods with higher rates of unemployment. This task developed my skills in data cleaning, trend analysis, and using visualizations to extract insights from temporal data.
